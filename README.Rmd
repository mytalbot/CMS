# Composite measures schemes (cms)

The cms package uses tabular data from rat epilepsy studies and applies a composite measures scheme (via PCA) to select the most prominent features. Further, variables can be selected to perform cluster analysis on a subset in order to build a composite score. Finally, the cluster distribution is displayed for the subgroups and allows severity assessment between animal models.

*Please note:* the cms_analysis and cms_cluster functions are deprecated.

## Dependencies
The cms package has some dependencies. We advise installing/updating the following packages before using cms:  

* ggplot2
* dplyr
* factoextra

## Installation
You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
  
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mytalbot/cms")
library(cms)
```

## Example cms
The following example uses the (pre-cleaned) internalized epilepsy data 
(episet_full) set with three experimental subgroups. Further, the feature 
selection is repeated 100-fold. The example uses the new `cms` function. Please
note that all variables that shall be included must be specified in the `vars`
object.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
```


## Working example
**Note:** the following example shows the pooled data from the episet_full set,
using the pooled subgroups. You might need to filter them, if you are interested
in specific subsets.

```{r example}
library(cms)
# Do the cms feature analysis (with a limited set of variables)
usecase <- cms(raw        = episet_full,
               runs       = 100,
               idvariable = "animal_id",
               setsize    = 0.8,
               variables  = c("Sacc_pref", "social_interaction", 
                              "burrowing_rat", "openfield_rat"),
               maxPC      = 1:4,
               clusters   = 3, 
               showplot   = FALSE)

# This also shows the plot
usecase$p
```
