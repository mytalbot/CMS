# Composite measure schemes (cms)
The cms package uses tabular data from rat epilepsy studies and applies a composite measures scheme (via PCA) to select the most prominent features. Further, variables can be selected to perform cluster analysis on a subset in order to build a composite score. Finally, the cluster distribution is displayed for the subgroups in the data and can be compared within models in terms of severity assessment.



## Dependencies
The cms package has some other package dependencies. We advise installing/updating the following packages before using cms:  

* ade4  
* scatterplot3d  
* lattice  
* corrplot  
* made4  
* caret  
* ggplot2  
* reshape2  
* plyr  
* RColorBrewer  
* gplots  
* e1072  

## Installation
You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
  
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mytalbot/cms")
library(cms)
```

## Example
The following example uses the (pre-cleaned) internalized epilepsy data set with three experimental subgroups. Further, the feature selection is repeated 100-fold. The variable `scorevars=NA` ensures that the most prominent features in the subgroups are determined. For cluster distribution analysis specific variables must be selected in `scorevars` (see Vignette).

```{r example}
library(cms)
cms_cl        <- cms_clusters(episet_full, 
                              runs        = 100, 
                              emptysize   = 0.2, 
                              trainsize   = 0.8, 
                              idvariable  = "animal_id", 
                              varstart    = 14, 
                              exclude     = "Seizures_n",
                              scorevars   =  NA) 
cms_cl

```
